# <s>Command_Line</s> MineSweeper Game & Solver

after installing ubuntu for the first time. 
and checking some of the default apps, I encountered the good old MineSweeper. then I decided to make a mine sweeper game and an AI program that can solve it

#### to-do:

- <s>implement the AI program to solve the game</s>
- <s>maybe implement a GUI for regular users</s>
- <s>combine the two features for the final game</s>
- add a more advanced solver algorithm, using probability
