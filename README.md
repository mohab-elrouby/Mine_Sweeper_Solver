# Command_Line MineSweeper Game  

after installing ubuntu for the first time. 
and checking some of the default apps, I encountered the good old MineSweeper. then Idecided to make a mine sweeper game and an AI program that can solve it
and here we are in phase one after building the game itself.


#### to-do:

- <s>implement the AI program to solve the game</s>
- maybe implement a GUI for regular users
